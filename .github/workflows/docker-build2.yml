## ⚙️ CI/CD Automation with GitHub Actions
This repository includes **GitHub Actions workflows** inside `.github/workflows/`.  
They automate key DevOps tasks such as:
1. **Building Docker Images** from code.
2. **Pushing Images** to Docker Hub.
3. **Deploying** to a Linux server automatically.

> Secrets like `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` are stored securely in GitHub **Actions Secrets**.

Example workflow file: `.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`  
This triggers automatically on every push to `main` and keeps my projects production-ready.
